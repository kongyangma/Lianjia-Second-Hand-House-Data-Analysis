# About the Project

We gathered information about second-hand apartments in Beijing from Lianjia. Now we would like to use various Python libraries, including 
NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn, to do data analysis and data visualzation.

There are 11 variables in the datasets. Each will be analyzed and visualized.
